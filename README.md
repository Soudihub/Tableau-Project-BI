The biggest challenge of Factoring is to predict if and when invoices will be paid. The factor provides funds against this future payment to the business by buying their invoice. The factor then collects the payment and charges their interest rate. If the invoice isn't paid, the factor loses their advanced funds. 

The EDA for this project is done using Tableau 

Tableau Dashboard

Using regression models such as LinearRegression, GradientBoostingRegressor and LighgbmRegressor the number of days a client delays payment is predicted.
